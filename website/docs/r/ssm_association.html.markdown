    values = ["${aws_instance.example.id}"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the SSM document to apply.
* `association_name` - (Optional) The descriptive name for the association.
* `document_version` - (Optional) The document version you want to associate with the target(s). Can be a specific version or the default version.
* `instance_id` - (Optional) The instance ID to apply an SSM document to. Use `targets` with key `InstanceIds` for document schema versions 2.0 and above.
* `output_location` - (Optional) An output location block. Output Location is documented below.
* `parameters` - (Optional) A block of arbitrary string parameters to pass to the SSM document.
* `schedule_expression` - (Optional) A cron expression when the association will be applied to the target(s).

* `max_errors` - (Optional) The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.
* `automation_target_parameter_name` - (Optional) Specify the target for the association. This target is required for associations that use an `Automation` document and target resources by using rate controls.

Output Location (`output_location`) is an S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this association:

* `s3_bucket_name` - (Required) The S3 bucket name.
* `s3_key_prefix` - (Optional) The S3 bucket prefix. Results stored in the root if not configured.

Targets specify what instance IDs or tags to apply the document to and has these keys:

* `key` - (Required) Either `InstanceIds` or `tag:Tag Name` to specify an EC2 tag.
* `values` - (Required) A list of instance IDs or tag values. AWS currently limits this list size to one value.
