# Resource: aws_guardduty_organization_configuration

Manages the GuardDuty Organization Configuration in the current AWS Region. The AWS account utilizing this resource must have been assigned as a delegated Organization administrator account, e.g. via the [`aws_guardduty_organization_admin_account` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/guardduty_organization_admin_account.html). More information about Organizations support in GuardDuty can be found in the [GuardDuty User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_organizations.html).

~> **NOTE:** This is an advanced Terraform resource. Terraform will automatically assume management of the GuardDuty Organization Configuration without import and perform no actions on removal from the Terraform configuration.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "example" {
  enable = true
}

resource "aws_guardduty_organization_configuration" "example" {
  auto_enable = true
  detector_id = aws_guardduty_detector.example.id
}
```

## Attributes Reference
